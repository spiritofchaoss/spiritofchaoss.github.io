My scientific curiosity extends to exploring protein structure, function, design, and their diverse applications using data science, machine learning, and AI. Outside of work, I find solace in rigorous gym sessions, fostering companionship with my dog Comet, refining the art of coffee brewing, and sitting back and enjoying playing video games."

    "text": "My scientific interest\nI worked with proteins most of my professional career so it’s a no-brainer I like it alot. I will give a few reasons why I love proteins so much:\n1. Arguably the most important biomolecules: Proteins are functionally critical to life. They act as enzymes, structural components, signaling molecules, and transporters, making them central to understanding biological processes.\n2. High medical relevance and is connected to many diseases: Proteins are at the heart of health and disease.Understanding proteins can lead to breakthroughs in treating conditions like therapy of cancers, immune disorders, infections, and other diseases.\n3. A great choice for your next therapeutic development: Proteins-based therapeutics are highly successful for clinical use. They are both effective and versatile. There are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), fusion proteins, enzymes, and more.\n4. Interdisciplinary in nature: Proteins intersects with various disciplines, including genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and biophysics. This opens rooms for integration of diverse perspectives.\n5. They are a thing of beauty: Three-dimensional structures of proteins are also aesthetically fascinating. Plot them on different tools and experience the colorful visualizations."

    "text": "{{&lt; fa screwdriver-wrench &gt;}}My hobbies\nThose who know me will tell you that I only think about coffee. What’s for breakfast? Answer: coffee. What are you watching there? Answer: coffee. Do you want to hang out? Answer: Yes, for coffee. I love coffee for its complexity, the ritual, the conversations, and of course, the science. I learn more about coffee notes, their origin, processing, and other nerdy things. Seeing people commenting on my coffee setup while I explain and serve them a cup of latte brings me joy and fuels this passion. It’s funny that I started exploring specialty coffee because I wanted to limit the caloric intake of cream and sugar in my daily coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram I had a wonderful opportunity to join a cupping event for the Many Hands, Beautiful Hills event at Catalog Coffee.\n\nThis is a good segway into my next biggest hobby, fitness. In particular, I love to powerlift. I have long sessions at the gym to work on my squats, bench, and deadlifts. I have competed in two powerlifting competitions in the past, and they were nothing short of an adrenaline rush. Powerlifting competitions are an opportunity to challenge myself and show how strong I am."
